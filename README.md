Python Patchwork Creator:

This project allows users to generate customizable patchworks featuring geometric patterns. Using Python's graphics library, the program creates 5×5, 7×7, or 9×9 grids of patchworks, where the designs and colors are based on user preferences and individual-specific details. The program includes strong input validation and features an interactive mode that enables users to select and modify patches with their mouse and keyboard.
